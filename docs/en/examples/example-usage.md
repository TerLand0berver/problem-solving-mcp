- **Consider Parallel Optimization**: For complex projects, analyze parallel potential early
- **Balance Roles**: Ensure good mix of technical and management roles

### 3. Quality Assurance
- **Check Early and Often**: Use quality checks throughout the process
- **Address Issues Promptly**: Don't let medium/high severity issues accumulate
- **Iterate Based on Feedback**: Use improvement suggestions actively

### 4. Execution Management
- **Monitor Progress**: Regular execution reports keep projects on track
- **Manage Dependencies**: Use dependency analysis for complex workflows
- **Learn from Experience**: Create reflections for continuous improvement
